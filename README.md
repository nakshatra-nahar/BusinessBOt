businessBot is a chatbot framework written in Go. But there's a catch, you don't need to know a lick of Go! Configure your bot via YAML files, extend functionality by writing scripts in your favorite language.

The philosophy behind businessBot is to create very simple, lightweight, "dumb" bots that interact with APIs and scripts which house a bot's business logic. The word **flott** comes from the German word meaning _quick_/_speedy_.
